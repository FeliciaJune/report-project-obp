# Student Report System Project – OBP

This project is a **Student Report System** developed for the **Object Based Programming (OBP)** course. It is built using **Java Spring Boot** for the backend, **HTML & CSS** for the frontend, and **phpMyAdmin** for the database. The system allows teachers to input student grades and allows students to input their achievements and view the achievements card. Both **teachers and students can view the report card** at any time and **calculate pass/fail status**.

## Note
This project runs locally. Please start it on **localhost** using the Spring Boot configuration (`server.port=8082`) and a phpMyAdmin database.
